These tie-ups not only promise to enhance student employability by a manifold, but also take the lead in encouraging 'innovative' learning like never before. Taking the league forward, we have established various innovation labs to provide students hands-on experience in various modern-day technologies. We impart experiential learning and thereby progressively enhance the competencies of our teaching staff and our students. I, thus, invite you to join our movement to create corporate citizens who become role models, wherever they go, for developing their professional career.
